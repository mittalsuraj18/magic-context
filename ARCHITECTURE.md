# Architecture

> All `src/` paths below are relative to `packages/plugin/` — the published npm package.

## Pattern Overview

**Overall:** Use a plugin-driven orchestration pattern centered on `@opencode-ai/plugin` entrypoints in `src/index.ts`.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Route all OpenCode integration through thin adapters in `src/plugin/` and keep feature logic in `src/hooks/`, `src/features/`, and `src/tools/`.
- Use SQLite-backed durable state from `src/features/magic-context/storage*.ts` for tags, pending ops, compartments, memories, dreamer queue state, message-history index (FTS-backed), git-commit index, key-file pinning state, todo-state snapshots, and per-session cache-stability watermarks (`cleared_reasoning_through_tag`, `stripped_placeholder_ids`, `todo_synthetic_*`).
- Use hidden subagents from `src/agents/*.ts` (`historian`, `historian-editor`, `dreamer`, `sidekick`) plus prompt builders in `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/task-prompts.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/sidekick/agent.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/sidekick/core.ts`, and `src/hooks/magic-context/compartment-prompt.ts`.
- Replay all persistent message mutations (reasoning clearing, structural-noise stripping, placeholder stripping, merged-assistant reasoning stripping, processed-image stripping, system-injected stripping, caveman compression, synthetic-todowrite injection) on every transform pass — including defer passes — so the wire shape stays byte-identical and Anthropic prompt cache survives.
- Select the SQLite backend at runtime in `src/shared/sqlite.ts` — `bun:sqlite` under Bun, `better-sqlite3` under Node (Pi) and Electron (Desktop). Electron uses `nativeBinding` via `src/shared/native-binding.ts` to load the matching ABI prebuild from the per-session cache directory.

## Data Flow

**Plugin startup:**
1. Load and merge config from `src/config/index.ts` — prefer project-root `magic-context.jsonc`, then `.opencode/magic-context.*`, then user config. Invalid leaf fields fall back to defaults with collected warnings rather than disabling the whole plugin.
2. Detect conflicts via `detectConflicts()` (DCP, OMO context-management hooks, OpenCode auto-compaction/prune). When any conflict is active, disable the full Magic Context runtime and send an ignored startup-warning message to the user's active session via `sendConflictWarning()`.
3. Start the RPC server (`MagicContextRpcServer` on localhost; ephemeral port published to `session_meta` for TUI plugin discovery).
4. Start the auto-update checker hook (`src/hooks/auto-update-checker/`) — fires once per plugin process from `chat.message`, with on-disk cross-process dedup via `getMagicContextStorageDir()/last-update-check.json`.
5. Start the dream-schedule timer (`src/plugin/dream-timer.ts`) — singleton per process; immediate startup tick + 15-minute interval; iterates every registered project directory.
6. Build session hooks in `src/plugin/hooks/create-session-hooks.ts` — create the tagger, scheduler, and compaction handler.
7. Register tools in `src/plugin/tool-registry.ts` — open the SQLite database (runtime-selected backend), initialize embeddings (lazy), and expose `ctx_reduce` (gated by `ctx_reduce_enabled`), `ctx_expand`, `ctx_note`, `ctx_memory` (with full action set; dreamer-only actions enforced at runtime by inspecting `toolContext.agent`), and `ctx_search`.
8. Register OpenCode entrypoints in `src/index.ts` — bind message transforms, system-prompt transform, event hooks, command hooks, and hidden agents (`historian`, `historian-editor`, `dreamer`, `sidekick`).

**Session transform pipeline:**
1. Enter `createMagicContextHook()` in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook.ts` — open persistent storage, set up in-memory maps (`injectionCache`, `liveSessionState`, etc.), and create the transform.
2. The outer wrapper in `src/plugin/messages-transform.ts` catches `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` transient errors and other failures, persisting a short summary to `session_meta.last_transform_error` and returning unmodified messages on failure so OpenCode's prompt loop always proceeds (issue #23).
3. Run the transform from `src/hooks/magic-context/transform.ts` — tag messages, load session state, prepare compartment injection, and schedule deferred work. On every pass (including defer), replay persisted reasoning clearing using `replayClearedReasoning()` and `replayStrippedInlineThinking()` from `src/hooks/magic-context/strip-content.ts`; replay caveman compression via `replayCavemanCompression()` and `stripReasoningFromMergedAssistants()` (Anthropic-only); replay stripped placeholders and structural noise. The merged-assistant reasoning strip and the empty-content sentinel handling are provider-aware (Anthropic-specific vs. generic).
4. Run postprocessing in `src/hooks/magic-context/transform-postprocess-phase.ts` — apply pending ops, heuristic cleanup, reasoning cleanup, stale reduce-call cleanup, compartment rendering, nudge placement, deferred-note nudges, **synthetic-todowrite injection (B7)**, and auto-search hint generation. Stripped placeholder message IDs are read from `stripped_placeholder_ids` in `session_meta` (via `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts`) and replayed on every pass; the persisted set is updated when new empty shells are detected on cache-busting passes only.
5. Persist session state through storage helpers exported by `src/features/magic-context/storage.ts`.

**System-prompt adjunct injection:**
- The `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook in `src/hooks/magic-context/system-prompt-hash.ts` injects four adjunct blocks into the system prompt array: `<project-docs>` (root `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `STRUCTURE.md` when `dreamer.inject_docs=true`), `<user-profile>` (active user memories when `dreamer.user_memories.enabled=true`), `<key-files>` (session-scoped pinned files when `dreamer.pin_key_files.enabled=true`), and Magic Context agent guidance text (when `system_prompt_injection.enabled=true` and the active agent isn't matched by `skip_signatures`).
- Adjunct content is cached in memory and only re-read on cache-busting passes, so doc edits don't trigger mid-session cache busts.
- The `Today's date:` line is frozen per session via `stickyDateBySession` and updated only on cache-busting passes — prevents midnight date flips from causing spurious rebuilds.
- The reasoning-clearing watermark (`cleared_reasoning_through_tag` column in `session_meta`) is a persisted integer so clearing survives across OpenCode message rebuilds.
- Magic Context skips system-prompt injection entirely for OpenCode's internal `title`, `summary`, and `compaction` agent prompts (signature-detected) so small-model utility calls don't get the full Magic Context prompt.

**Note nudge trigger gating:**
- Three triggers can fire a note-nudge: historian publication, commit detection (text-based heuristic in `tag-messages.ts`), and `todowrite` calls where ALL todo items have a terminal status (`completed` or `cancelled`). Intermediate todowrite calls during active work do not trigger the nudge.
- The `tool.execute.after` handler in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook-handlers.ts` captures the current todo state into `session_meta.last_todo_state` on EVERY todowrite call (independent of the nudge trigger) — this snapshot drives synthetic-todowrite injection (see below).
- A 15-minute cooldown plus visibility-aware suppression prevents the same note from re-surfacing too aggressively. Suppression releases as soon as a prior `ctx_note(read)` result is no longer visible in transformed messages.

**Synthetic-todowrite (todo retention across cache busts):**
1. `tool.execute.after` captures normalized todo state into `session_meta.last_todo_state` on every real `todowrite` call (capture is pure DB write — no message mutation, cache-safe).
2. On a cache-busting transform pass, B7 in `transform-postprocess-phase.ts` reads `last_todo_state`, computes `mc_synthetic_todo_${sha256(stateJson)[:16]}`, and either idempotently re-injects (when the call_id matches the persisted one) or fresh-injects a synthetic `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair into the latest assistant message. The injection point is AFTER tagging and applyPendingOperations so the synthetic part is never tagged or targeted by `ctx_reduce` / heuristic cleanup.
3. On defer passes, B7 rebuilds from the PERSISTED snapshot (`todo_synthetic_state_json` column), NOT from the current `last_todo_state`. This keeps wire bytes identical to the prior cache-bust pass even when the agent has called `todowrite` since — preserving Anthropic prompt cache.
4. The persisted triple `(call_id, anchor_message_id, state_json)` lives in `session_meta`. Legacy rows from pre-stateJson builds (call_id and anchor populated, state_json empty) self-heal on the next idempotent re-inject by backfilling state_json from the current `last_todo_state` under sha256 collision-resistance guarantees.

**Memory and search flow:**
1. Create, update, merge, archive, or list memories through `src/tools/ctx-memory/tools.ts`. The action schema exposes the full set (`write/delete/list/update/merge/archive`); primary-agent calls are runtime-gated to `write` and `delete` only by inspecting `toolContext.agent`.
2. Store canonical records in `src/features/magic-context/memory/storage-memory.ts` and sync full-text search through the FTS triggers created in `src/features/magic-context/storage-db.ts`.
3. Generate and store embeddings through `src/features/magic-context/memory/embedding.ts` and `src/features/magic-context/memory/storage-memory-embeddings.ts`. Three embedding paths: immediate best-effort write on `ctx_memory` mutations; periodic batch sweep via the dream timer (every 15 min, drains projects in descending recency); lazy fallback inside `ctx_search`. Local embeddings use `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `@huggingface/transformers` runtime-loaded with a cross-process model-load lock and heartbeat (`embedding-local.ts`).
4. `ctx_search` (`src/tools/ctx-search/`) provides a unified search surface over project memories, raw user/assistant message history (FTS-backed via `src/features/magic-context/message-index.ts`), and indexed git commits (via `src/features/magic-context/git-commits/`). Session facts are NOT a `ctx_search` source — they're always injected into `<session-history>`. Raw-message hits are filtered to ordinals strictly before the last compartment boundary so the live tail (already in context) isn't returned.
5. Inject cached project memories into `<session-history>` through `src/hooks/magic-context/inject-compartments.ts`. Memories already visible in the rendered `<session-history>` are hard-filtered from `ctx_search` results via persisted `session_meta.memory_block_ids`.

**Message-history indexing:**
- `src/features/magic-context/message-index.ts` maintains an FTS5-backed index of raw user/assistant messages keyed by `(session_id, ordinal, message_id, role, text)`.
- Index maintenance runs OUTSIDE the search hot path: async startup reconciliation processes ordinals above the `last_indexed_ordinal` watermark; live event indexing fires from `message.updated` events; `searchMessages()` is a pure FTS query with no freshness check.
- The reconciliation watermark is per-session; revert-aware cleanup runs on `message.removed` events.

**Git-commit indexing:**
- `src/features/magic-context/git-commits/indexer.ts` reads HEAD-only non-merge commits via `git log` (NUL-byte-free format separator `\x1f`), bounded by `experimental.git_commit_indexing.{since_days, max_commits}`.
- Embeddings are generated through the same embedding provider chain as memories.
- Indexing fires from the dream-timer startup tick and periodic interval; manual `/ctx-dream` does NOT trigger commit indexing.

**Dreamer flow:**
1. Detect eligible projects during `message.updated` handling in `src/hooks/magic-context/hook.ts` (debounced per-project, 12-hour cooldown).
2. Enqueue projects on a schedule through `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/scheduler.ts` and `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/queue.ts`. Queue rows are project-scoped — each host (OpenCode or Pi instance) only dequeues work for projects it has loaded.
3. Serialize dream runs with the lease in `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/lease.ts` (2-minute TTL with periodic renewal during long tasks).
4. Spawn one child session per task from `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/runner.ts` using prompts from `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/task-prompts.ts`. Each successful run also writes a row to `dream_runs` for dashboard visibility.
5. Tasks include the configured maintenance suite (consolidate, verify, archive-stale, improve, maintain-docs) plus optional post-task phases: user-memory candidate review (when `dreamer.user_memories.enabled`), smart-note evaluation (when pending smart notes exist), and key-file identification (when `dreamer.pin_key_files.enabled`).
6. A circuit breaker aborts remaining tasks and post-task phases after 3 consecutive identical-error failures, surfacing as a synthetic `circuit-breaker` task entry. Skips on AbortError and lease-loss errors.
7. Each subagent prompt call iterates the resolved model fallback chain (`dreamer.fallback_models` → builtin chain) via `promptSyncWithModelSuggestionRetry`. Abort/timeout/context-overflow short-circuits the chain so caller emergency-recovery still fires.

**Command augmentation flow:**
1. Register `/ctx-status`, `/ctx-flush`, `/ctx-recomp`, `/ctx-aug`, and `/ctx-dream` in `src/features/builtin-commands/commands.ts`.
2. Intercept command execution in `src/hooks/magic-context/command-handler.ts`.
3. `/ctx-status` and `/ctx-recomp` route through the RPC server when TUI is connected (showing native TUI dialogs) and through ignored-message notifications otherwise (Desktop/Web).
4. `/ctx-recomp` accepts an optional `<start>-<end>` range — partial recomp snaps the requested range to enclosing compartment boundaries and only rebuilds that span.
5. `/ctx-aug` runs sidekick augmentation from `src/features/magic-context/sidekick/agent.ts`; the augmentation result is appended to the user's prompt (not injected at `message[0]`) before submission.
6. `/ctx-dream` enqueues an immediate-runtime dream request, force-clearing stale started rows past the lease TTL window.

- Pattern: SQLite repository plus FTS and embedding side tables.

**Unified search:**
- Purpose: Cross-source retrieval over memories, raw message history, and git commits with deterministic source ranking and embedding dedup across paths.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/search.ts`
- Pattern: Single embedding-per-query dispatched across all enabled sources; visible-memory hard-filter; sources opt-in via tool argument.

**Message-history index:**
- Purpose: FTS-backed raw user/assistant message search outside the transform hot path.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/message-index.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/message-index-async.ts`
- Pattern: Async reconciliation + live event indexing + pure-query reads.

**Git-commit index:**
- Purpose: Per-project HEAD-only commit corpus for `ctx_search` integration.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/git-commits/`
- Pattern: NUL-free git log reader + FTS index + embedding side table; populated by dream timer.

**Dream queue and lease:**
- Purpose: Run at most one dream worker at a time and survive restarts.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/queue.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/lease.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/storage-dream-state.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/dreamer/storage-dream-runs.ts`
- Pattern: SQLite-backed queue plus cooperative lease lock plus durable run-history table.

**Key-files pinning:**
- Purpose: Inject up to N project files into the system prompt as `<key-files>` content for the active session.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/key-files/identify-key-files.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/key-files/read-stats.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/key-files/storage-key-files.ts`
- Pattern: Per-session selection by Dreamer; budget-bound rendering; symlink-safe realpath check.

**User memory pipeline:**
- Purpose: Extract user behavioral observations from historian output, collect candidates, and promote recurring patterns to stable user memories.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/user-memory/storage-user-memory.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/user-memory/review-user-memories.ts`
- Pattern: Historian extracts candidates, dreamer reviews and promotes, system prompt injects stable memories.

**TUI ↔ server RPC:**
- Purpose: Localhost RPC for sidebar data, status/recomp dialogs, and TUI-action consumption.
- Location: `src/shared/rpc-server.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-client.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-utils.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-types.ts`, `src/shared/rpc-notifications.ts`, `src/plugin/rpc-handlers.ts`
- Pattern: Server publishes ephemeral port; TUI plugin polls for state and pushes notifications via the message queue.

**Plugin message bus (legacy):**
- Purpose: Historical SQLite-backed TUI ↔ server bus, retained for migration compatibility.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/plugin-messages.ts`
- Pattern: Vestigial — superseded by RPC. Module remains for forward-compat with older TUI plugin versions that may still poll it; no active runtime callers in current code.

**Compaction markers:**
- Purpose: Inject OpenCode-compatible compaction boundaries into the message table so `filterCompacted` stops at historian's last compartment boundary, shrinking the transform-input array.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/compaction-marker.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/compaction-marker-manager.ts`
- Pattern: Write summary/compaction rows into OpenCode's DB after historian publishes; filter them out from raw reads. Stable feature (default `compaction_markers: true` since v0.16.x); raw-history readers strip `summary=true` / `finish="stop"` rows to preserve original ordinals.

**Auto-update checker:**
- Purpose: Self-update the cached `@latest` plugin install once per plugin process — OpenCode's plugin cache no longer auto-updates.
- Location: `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/checker.ts`, `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/cache.ts`, `src/hooks/auto-update-checker/constants.ts`
- Pattern: Fires from plugin init with on-disk cross-process dedup; rewrites the install-directory dependency entry + `bun.lock` (or runs `npm install` under OpenCode's npm-managed cache).

**Native-binding resolver (Electron):**
- Purpose: Fetch and cache the matching Electron ABI prebuild of `better-sqlite3` for OpenCode Desktop.
- Location: `src/shared/native-binding.ts`
- Pattern: Detect Electron via `process.versions.electron`; download via `nanotar` to `~/.cache/cortexkit/native-bindings/`; pass the resolved `.node` path to the SQLite constructor via `nativeBinding` option. Bun and plain-Node code paths use their native runtimes unmodified.

**Agent prompt pack:**
- Purpose: Keep hidden-agent identities and prompt text isolated from runtime wiring.
- Location: `src/agents/dreamer.ts`, `src/agents/historian.ts` (declares `HISTORIAN_AGENT` and `HISTORIAN_EDITOR_AGENT`), `src/agents/sidekick.ts`, `src/agents/magic-context-prompt.ts`
- Pattern: Constants plus prompt builders.

**Content stripping and replay:**
- Purpose: Strip reasoning, inline thinking, placeholder shells, structural noise, processed images, merged-assistant reasoning, system-injected stripping, and caveman compression from messages, and replay those operations on every transform pass to maintain stable message content across OpenCode's message rebuilds.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/strip-content.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman-cleanup.ts`, `src/hooks/magic-context/sentinel.ts`
- Pattern: Stateless strip functions plus deterministic in-place sentinel replacement (preserves message-part array shape across passes); paired with persisted watermarks (`cleared_reasoning_through_tag`, `stripped_placeholder_ids`, `tags.caveman_depth`) read from `session_meta` and `tags`. Several strips are provider-aware: `stripReasoningFromMergedAssistants` runs only for `anthropic`; whole-message empty-sentinel writes a `[dropped]` placeholder for non-Anthropic providers so openai-compatible providers don't see empty assistant messages.

**Caveman text compression (experimental):**
- Purpose: Apply oldest-first age-tier text compression to user/assistant text outside the protected tail when `ctx_reduce_enabled=false`.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/caveman.ts`
- Pattern: Four tiers (ultra/full/lite/untouched) keyed by raw-ordinal age within the non-protected region. Persisted per-tag `caveman_depth` enables byte-identical replay; depth escalation always recomputes from `source_contents` to avoid lossy double compression.

**Synthetic todowrite injection:**
- Purpose: Inject a deterministic `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair so the agent sees current todo state through its native todowrite mental model, even when real todowrite tool calls have been dropped from the prefix.
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/todo-view.ts` (renderer + hash), `src/hooks/magic-context/transform-postprocess-phase.ts` (B7 logic), `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts` (state persistence)
- Pattern: Capture-path is pure DB write; cache-busting-pass injects fresh and persists `(call_id, anchor_message_id, state_json)`; defer-pass replays from persisted state_json for byte-identical wire bytes.

**Persisted session meta:**
- Purpose: Store per-session scalars and JSON blobs that must survive across transform passes and OpenCode restarts.
- Location: `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-shared.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-persisted.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-session.ts`, `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta.ts`
- Pattern: `session_meta` SQLite table with `ensureColumn()` and versioned migrations; typed row interfaces with runtime guards; NULL coercion in `isSessionMetaRow()` so legacy rows don't trigger fallback-to-defaults on every read.

- Responsibilities: Defensive wrapper around the magic-context hook's transform — catches transient `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` errors and other failures, persists summary to `session_meta.last_transform_error`, and falls back to unmodified messages so OpenCode's prompt loop always proceeds.

**System-prompt transform entry:**
- Location: `src/hooks/magic-context/system-prompt-hash.ts`
- Triggers: `experimental.chat.system.transform`
- Responsibilities: Inject `<project-docs>`, `<user-profile>`, `<key-files>` adjunct blocks and Magic Context guidance text; persist `system_prompt_hash` for cache-stability decisions; skip injection for OpenCode's internal `title`/`summary`/`compaction` agents and any agents matched by user-configured `system_prompt_injection.skip_signatures`.

**Event entry:**
- Location: `src/plugin/event.ts`
- Triggers: OpenCode session and message lifecycle events.
- Responsibilities: Forward lifecycle events to the runtime event handler — `message.updated` (usage tracking, model drift detection, message-index live updates), `message.removed` (tag/index cleanup, sticky-reminder cleanup), `session.deleted` (full-session cleanup).

**Tool entry:**
- Location: `src/plugin/tool-registry.ts`
- Triggers: Plugin initialization.
- Responsibilities: Open storage, normalize arg schemas, and expose the supported tool set.

**Tool definition entry:**
- Location: `src/index.ts` (`tool.definition` hook calls `recordToolDefinition`)
- Triggers: OpenCode `tool.definition` hook (per tool per flight).
- Responsibilities: Record tool description and parameter token counts per `(provider, model, agent, tool_id)` for sidebar token attribution, with content-fingerprint short-circuit to avoid re-measuring stable definitions.

**RPC server entry:**
- Location: `src/shared/rpc-server.ts` (started from `src/index.ts`)
- Triggers: Plugin initialization.
- Responsibilities: Bind localhost RPC server on ephemeral port; publish port via `session_meta` for TUI discovery; serve sidebar/status/recomp/notification endpoints registered by `src/plugin/rpc-handlers.ts`.

## Session Modes

Magic Context runs in three effective modes depending on `ctx_reduce_enabled` and whether the session is a subagent. The mode decides which of the heavier features (historian, nudges, prompt-adjunct injections) run for that session, while tag/drop/heuristic plumbing stays on everywhere so any subsequent manual or automated reduction still works.

| Feature | Primary + `ctx_reduce_enabled: true` | Primary + `ctx_reduce_enabled: false` | Subagents (any `ctx_reduce_enabled`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tag DB records | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `§N§` tag prefix injection in message text | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `ctx_reduce` tool | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Historian / compartments / compressor | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Compartment injection (`<session-history>`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| `<project-docs>`, `<user-profile>`, `<key-files>` system-prompt blocks | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Rolling / tool-heavy / sticky / deferred-note nudges | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Synthetic-todowrite injection | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Auto-search hint | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Heuristic tool drops at execute threshold | ✓ (once per user turn) | ✓ (once per user turn) | ✓ (every execute pass — no once-per-turn guard) |
| Heuristic reasoning clearing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 85 % force-materialization | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| 95 % block + emergency recovery | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ (overflow handled via `overflow-detection.ts` only; no recovery flag persisted) |
| Experimental age-tier caveman text compression | ✗ | opt-in via `experimental.caveman_text_compression.enabled` | ✗ |

**Subagent rationale:** subagents are driven by a parent agent, have bounded lifetimes, and often run in parallel (council, historian, sidekick, dreamer child sessions). They still benefit from automatic heuristic drops on their own context at execute passes (running on EVERY execute pass, not once-per-turn — long-running subagents are effectively one parent turn, and they'd starve under the parent's once-per-turn gate), but turning on historian, nudges, or prompt-adjunct injections in each subagent would create redundant work and per-agent cache churn. Subagents that run into overflow fall back to the existing `overflow-detection.ts` path; the detected limit is recorded so future passes use the lower value, but no emergency-recovery flag is persisted because subagents don't consume that path.

**`ctx_reduce_enabled: false` rationale:** removes agent-facing reduction machinery (the tool itself, nudges asking the agent to use it, and `§N§` prefix injection the agent can't act on) while keeping the deterministic parts (historian, heuristic drops, compartment injection, memory, synthetic-todowrite). Users who want a fully automatic pipeline can opt in and optionally enable caveman age-tier compression to recover most of the win that manual `ctx_reduce` gives for long user / assistant text parts.

## Error Handling

**Strategy:** Fail closed when persistent storage is unavailable in `src/plugin/tool-registry.ts` and `src/hooks/magic-context/hook.ts` — the plugin disables itself rather than running with ephemeral state that would silently grow the prompt past provider limits. Fail open inside per-turn handlers by logging and skipping unsafe mutations. Wrap the outer message transform in `src/plugin/messages-transform.ts` so transient `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` errors and other failures don't crash OpenCode's prompt loop (issue #23). Stop OpenCode command fallthrough with sentinel errors from `src/hooks/magic-context/command-handler.ts`.

**Provider error parsing:** `src/features/magic-context/overflow-detection.ts` parses provider-specific context-overflow errors (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot) and persists the detected limit to `session_meta.detected_context_limit` so subsequent passes use the lower value. `needs_emergency_recovery` is set for primary sessions; subagents skip emergency-recovery state because they don't consume that path.

**Subagent model fallback:** `promptSyncWithModelSuggestionRetry` in `src/shared/model-suggestion-retry.ts` iterates the resolved fallback chain (user-configured `fallback_models` or builtin chain) on retryable failures. Abort, timeout, and context-overflow errors short-circuit the chain — those won't succeed on a different model and the caller's emergency-recovery path handles them. Suggestion retry ("did you mean X?") runs inside each attempt.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Logging:** Use buffered file logging from `src/shared/logger.ts` and write to the temp-file path returned by `getLogFilePath()`. Per-session logs use `sessionLog(sessionId, message)`; module-level logs use `log(message)`. Heavy logging batches to disk to avoid blocking the transform path.

**Caching:** Use deferred reductions, cached memory-block injection, per-session TTL tracking, anchored nudge placement, persisted reminder-replay state, per-session live injection cache, persisted system-prompt hash, and persisted todo-snapshot replay state — all coordinated through `src/hooks/magic-context/` and `src/features/magic-context/storage-meta-*.ts`.

**Storage:** Use the SQLite database created by `src/features/magic-context/storage-db.ts` under the cortexkit data directory resolved by `src/shared/data-path.ts` (`~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db` on Linux/macOS, XDG-equivalent on Windows). Legacy OpenCode-plugin-folder DBs are migrated forward on first boot. The same DB is shared cross-harness between OpenCode and Pi; session-scoped tables include a `harness` discriminator (`'opencode'` / `'pi'`) while project-scoped tables (memories, git commits) are shared.

**Schema migrations:** `src/features/magic-context/migrations.ts` declares versioned migrations v1–v11 (v10 added `tool_owner_message_id` for composite tool-tag identity; v11 added `todo_synthetic_*` columns for synthetic-todowrite). Migration runner uses `schema_migrations` table with version-ordered execution and sibling-startup race protection (duplicate-insert is tolerated).

**Harness-aware behavior:** `src/shared/harness.ts` exposes `setHarness()`/`getHarness()` for the runtime to identify itself; production INSERTs into session-scoped tables tag rows with the current harness. Pi-specific session-resolution paths are skipped on OpenCode and vice versa.

## Tag Identity (v3.3.1+)

**Tag types:** `message`, `file`, `tool`. Each row in the `tags` table represents one source-content unit that can be tagged with `§N§` and dropped/truncated/replayed by the runtime.

**Identity composition by type:**

- **`message` and `file` tags:** identified by `(session_id, message_id)`. The `message_id` for these is a synthetic content id (`<msgId>:p<partIndex>` for text, `<msgId>:fileN` for files). These ids are globally unique within a session.

- **`tool` tags:** identified by `(session_id, message_id, tool_owner_message_id)` — a *composite* identity. For tool tags, `message_id` is the OpenCode-generated callID (e.g. `read:32`). Pre-v3.3.1 the runtime keyed tool tags by callID alone, but OpenCode reuses a callID counter per assistant turn — so two assistant turns that each invoke `read:32` produced the SAME callID for different invocations. The fix: include the *owning assistant message id* in the key so each invocation gets its own row.

**Schema enforcement:** schema migration v10 (`src/features/magic-context/migrations.ts`) adds `tool_owner_message_id` (`TEXT NULL`), a partial UNIQUE index `idx_tags_tool_composite` on `(session_id, message_id, tool_owner_message_id) WHERE type='tool' AND tool_owner_message_id IS NOT NULL`, and a partial lookup index `idx_tags_tool_null_owner` on `(session_id, message_id) WHERE type='tool' AND tool_owner_message_id IS NULL` to back lazy adoption.

**Helper API surface (`src/features/magic-context/storage-tags.ts`):**

- `getToolTagNumberByOwner(db, sessionId, callId, ownerMsgId)`: composite-identity lookup.
- `getNullOwnerToolTag(db, sessionId, callId)`: find a legacy NULL-owner orphan to lazily adopt.
- `adoptNullOwnerToolTag(db, tagId, ownerMsgId)`: attempt to claim a NULL-owner row (NULL guard ensures first claim wins).
- `getPersistedToolOwnerNearestPrior(db, sessionId, callId, beforeMessageId)`: derive the most recent prior owner for a tool result whose invocation isn't in the visible window.
- `deleteToolTagsByOwner(db, sessionId, ownerMsgId)`: cascade delete on `message.removed`.

**Owner derivation (`src/hooks/magic-context/tag-messages.ts`):**

For each tool observation in a transform pass:

1. **Invocation parts** (`tool-invocation` / `tool_use`): owner = the message hosting the part.
2. **Result parts** (`tool` with output / `tool_result`): pop the FIFO queue of unpaired invocations for that callId; owner = the popped invocation's message id.
3. **Result-only window** (invocation compacted away): fall back to `getPersistedToolOwnerNearestPrior` for the most recent prior persisted owner; if none found, last-resort owner = the result's own message id.

The same logic mirrors in `src/hooks/magic-context/read-session-chunk.ts: getRawSessionTagKeysThrough` so the drop queue produces composite keys that match what the tagger persisted.

**Cleanup paths:**

- `deleteTagsByMessageId(db, sessionId, messageId)` (called from `event-handler.ts` on `message.removed`) deletes BOTH content-id-scoped tags (text/file on the removed message) AND owner-scoped tool tags (`tool_owner_message_id == messageId`).
- `applyHeuristicCleanup` keys both the tag-side index and fingerprint-side map by composite `<ownerMsgId>\x00<callId>`. The fingerprint VALUE includes ownerMsgId too, so cross-owner pairs with same `(toolName, args)` produce DISTINCT fingerprints and are NOT merged.

**Legacy NULL-owner handling:** rows written by pre-v3.3.1 plugin versions have `tool_owner_message_id = NULL`. The Layer B backfill (`src/features/magic-context/tool-owner-backfill.ts`) populates those rows from OpenCode's session DB on plugin upgrade (lease-based concurrency, batched commits). When backfill is skipped (no OpenCode DB attached) lazy adoption converts orphans to non-NULL on the next observation. Drop queue and heuristic cleanup gracefully fall back to bare-callId match for unbackfilled NULL-owner rows.
