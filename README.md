# Magic Context

Your AI coding agent forgets everything the moment a conversation gets long enough. Context windows fill up, old messages get dropped, and the agent loses track of decisions it made twenty minutes ago. Magic Context fixes this.

It's an [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) plugin that runs a background historian — a separate, lightweight model that compresses older conversation into structured summaries and durable facts while the main agent keeps working. The agent never stops to summarize its own history. It never notices the rewriting happening beneath it. And because every mutation is cache-aware, nothing gets invalidated until the provider's cached prefix expires, so you're not paying to throw away work that's already cached.

Across sessions, architecture decisions, constraints, and preferences persist in a cross-session memory system. A new conversation starts with everything the previous one learned, without replaying old transcripts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cortexkit/magic-context-opencode
```

Add it to your OpenCode config (`opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": ["@cortexkit/magic-context-opencode"]
}
```

Magic Context replaces OpenCode's built-in compaction — the two cannot run together:

```jsonc
{
  "compaction": {
    "auto": false,
    "prune": false
  }
}
```

---

## Quick Start

Create `magic-context.jsonc` in your project root (or `.opencode/magic-context.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "enabled": true,

  // Optional: which model the historian uses
  "historian": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4",
    "fallback_models": ["anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku"]
  }
}
```

That's it. Everything else has sensible defaults. For user-wide settings, put the config at `~/.config/opencode/magic-context.jsonc` — project config merges on top.

## What Your Agent Gets

Magic Context gives the agent four tools and injects structured context automatically. Here's what each tool is for in practice.

### `ctx_reduce` — Shed weight

After a tool-heavy turn (large grep results, file reads, bash output), the agent calls `ctx_reduce` to mark stale content for removal. Drops aren't applied immediately — they're queued until the cache expires or context pressure forces it. This means the agent can drop freely without worrying about cache invalidation timing.

```
ctx_reduce(drop="3-5,12")     // Drop tags 3, 4, 5, and 12
```

Recent tags (last 5 by default) are protected. Drops targeting them stay queued until they age out.

### `ctx_note` — Scratch notes that survive compression

Session notes are the agent's scratchpad for durable goals, constraints, and reminders. The historian reads these notes during compression, deduplicates them, and carries them forward — so a note written early in a session survives even after the raw history around it gets replaced by compartments.

```
ctx_note(action="write", content="Always run tests before committing on this repo.")
ctx_note(action="read")
```

### `ctx_memory` — Persistent cross-session knowledge

Architecture decisions, naming conventions, user preferences — anything that should survive across conversations. Memories are categorized and can be scoped to a project or shared globally. The historian automatically promotes qualifying session facts to memories, but the agent can also write them explicitly.

```
ctx_memory(action="write", category="ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS", content="Event sourcing for the orders domain.")
ctx_memory(action="search", query="authentication approach", category="CONSTRAINTS")
ctx_memory(action="delete", id=42)
```

### Automatic context injection

Every turn, Magic Context injects a `<session-history>` block into the conversation containing:

- **Project memories** — cross-session decisions, constraints, and preferences
- **Compartments** — structured summaries replacing older raw history
- **Session facts** — durable categorized facts from the current session
- **Session notes** — maintained `ctx_note` content

This block is stable between historian runs. When the agent writes new memories via `ctx_memory`, the write is persisted to the database immediately but the injected block doesn't change until the next historian run — so writes never bust the cache mid-conversation.

---

## How It Works

### Tagging

Every message, tool output, and file attachment gets a monotonically increasing `§N§` tag. The agent sees these inline and uses them to reference specific content when calling `ctx_reduce`. Tags persist in the database and resume across restarts.

### Queued reductions

When the agent calls `ctx_reduce`, drops go into a pending queue — not applied immediately. Two conditions trigger execution:

- **Cache expired** — enough time has passed that the cached prefix is likely stale (configurable, default 5 minutes)
- **Threshold reached** — context usage hits `execute_threshold_percentage` (default 65%), at which point waiting risks running out of space

Between those triggers, the conversation continues unchanged. The agent doesn't need to think about timing.

### Background historian

When local drops aren't buying enough headroom, Magic Context starts a historian — a separate lightweight model that reads an eligible prefix of raw history and produces:

- **Compartments** — chronological blocks that replace older raw messages
- **Facts** — durable decisions, constraints, and preferences (categorized)
- **Notes** — rewritten and deduplicated `ctx_note` content

The historian runs asynchronously. The main agent never waits for it. When the historian finishes, its output is materialized into the conversation on the next transform pass.

### Nudging

As context usage grows, Magic Context sends rolling reminders to the agent suggesting it reduce. Reminder cadence tightens as usage approaches the threshold. If the agent has recently called `ctx_reduce`, reminders are suppressed — it already knows. An emergency nudge at 80% always fires regardless of cooldown.

### Cross-session memory

After each historian run, qualifying facts are promoted to the persistent memory store. On every subsequent turn, active memories are injected alongside compartments in the `<session-history>` block. When a new session starts, it inherits all project and global memories from previous sessions.

Memories are searchable via `ctx_memory(action="search", ...)` using semantic embeddings (local by default) with full-text search as a fallback.

## Configuration

All settings live in `magic-context.jsonc` as flat top-level keys. See **[CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)** for the full reference — cache TTL tuning, historian model selection, embedding providers, memory settings, sidekick, and dreaming.

---

## Commands

### `/ctx-status`

Debug view of the current session: tag counts, pending drops, cache TTL, nudge state, historian progress, compartment coverage, and the last transform error. Run this when something seems stuck.

### `/ctx-flush`

Forces all queued operations to apply immediately, bypassing cache TTL. Reports what was released, skipped, or still deferred.

### `/ctx-recomp`

Rebuilds compartments, facts, and notes from raw session history. Use when stored historian state seems stale or structurally wrong.

### `/ctx-dream`

Runs the hidden dreamer maintenance pass on demand. Dreamer uses child OpenCode sessions to consolidate, verify, archive, and rewrite persistent memories, and can also keep architecture docs in sync.

---

## Storage

All state lives in a local SQLite database:

```
~/.local/share/opencode/storage/plugin/magic-context/context.db
```

If the database can't be opened, Magic Context disables itself.

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tags` | Tag assignments — message ID, tag number, session, status |
| `pending_ops` | Queued drop operations with execution status |
| `source_contents` | Raw content snapshots for reduction |
| `compartments` | Historian-produced structured history blocks |
| `session_facts` | Categorized durable facts from historian runs |
| `session_notes` | Maintained `ctx_note` content |
| `session_meta` | Per-session state — usage, nudge flags, anchors |
| `memories` | Cross-session persistent memories |
| `memory_embeddings` | Embedding vectors for semantic search |
| `dream_state` | Dreamer scheduling, lease, and task progress |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.x

### Scripts

```sh
bun run build          # Build the plugin
bun run typecheck      # Type-check without emitting
bun test               # Run tests
bun run lint           # Lint
bun run lint:fix       # Lint with auto-fix
bun run format         # Format
```

### Utility scripts

```sh
bun scripts/tail-view.ts             # Tail structured log output
bun scripts/context-dump.ts          # Dump context DB for a session
bun scripts/dream.ts                 # Print /ctx-dream guidance (needs live OpenCode)
bun scripts/backfill-embeddings.ts   # Backfill missing embeddings
```

Dream execution itself now requires a live OpenCode server because the dreamer runs as a hidden child-session agent. Use `/ctx-dream` inside OpenCode for the actual maintenance pass.
