# Configuration Reference

All settings are flat top-level keys in `magic-context.jsonc`. Create the file in your project root, `.opencode/magic-context.jsonc`, or `~/.config/opencode/magic-context.jsonc` for user-wide defaults. Project config merges on top of user config.

### JSON Schema

Add `$schema` to your config file for autocomplete and validation in VS Code and other editors:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexkit/opencode-magic-context/master/assets/magic-context.schema.json"
}
```

The setup wizard adds this automatically.

### Doctor

If something isn't working, run the doctor to auto-detect and fix common issues:

```bash
bunx @cortexkit/opencode-magic-context doctor
```

Doctor checks: OpenCode installation, plugin registration, `magic-context.jsonc` existence, conflicts (compaction, DCP, OMO hooks), and TUI sidebar configuration. It auto-fixes what it can.

## Cache Awareness

LLM providers cache conversation prefixes server-side. The cache window depends on your provider and subscription tier — Claude Pro offers 5 minutes, Max offers 1 hour, and pricing for cached vs. uncached tokens differs between API and subscription usage.

Magic Context defers all mutations until the cached prefix expires. The default `cache_ttl` of `"5m"` matches most providers. You can tune it:

```jsonc
{
  "cache_ttl": "5m"
}
```

Per-model overrides for mixed-model workflows:

```jsonc
{
  "cache_ttl": {
    "default": "5m",
    "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": "60m"
  }
}
```

Supported formats: `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`.

Higher-tier models with longer cache windows benefit from a longer TTL. Setting it too low wastes cache hits. Setting it too high delays reduction on long sessions.

## Core

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Master toggle. |
| `ctx_reduce_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | When `false`, hides `ctx_reduce` tool, disables all nudges/reminders, and strips reduction guidance from prompts. Heuristic cleanup, compartments, memory, and search still work. Useful for testing whether automatic cleanup alone is sufficient. |
| `cache_ttl` | `string` or `object` | `"5m"` | Time after a response before applying pending ops. String or per-model map. |
| `protected_tags` | `number` (1–100) | `20` | Last N active tags immune from immediate dropping. |
| `nudge_interval_tokens` | `number` | `10000` | Minimum token growth between rolling nudges. |
| `execute_threshold_percentage` | `number` (35–80) or `object` | `65` | Context usage that forces queued ops to execute. Capped at 80% max for cache safety. Supports per-model map. |
| `auto_drop_tool_age` | `number` | `100` | Auto-drop tool outputs older than N tags during execution. |
| `clear_reasoning_age` | `number` | `50` | Clear thinking/reasoning blocks older than N tags. |
| `iteration_nudge_threshold` | `number` | `15` | Consecutive assistant turns without user input before an iteration nudge. |
| `compartment_token_budget` | `number` | `20000` | Token budget for historian input chunks. |
| `historian_timeout_ms` | `number` | `300000` | Timeout per historian call (ms). |
| `history_budget_percentage` | `number` (0–1) | `0.15` | Fraction of usable context reserved for the history block. Triggers compression when exceeded. |
| `commit_cluster_trigger` | `object` | See below | Controls the commit-cluster historian trigger. |

### `commit_cluster_trigger`

A **commit cluster** is a distinct work phase where the agent made one or more git commits, separated from other commit clusters by meaningful user turns. For example, if the agent commits a fix, then the user asks a new question, and the agent commits another change — that's 2 commit clusters. This heuristic detects natural work-unit boundaries and fires historian to compartmentalize them, even when context pressure is low.

```jsonc
{
  "commit_cluster_trigger": {
    "enabled": true,    // default: true
    "min_clusters": 3   // default: 3, minimum: 1
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable commit-cluster based historian triggering. |
| `min_clusters` | `number` | `3` | Minimum number of commit clusters in the unsummarized tail before historian fires. The tail must also contain at least `compartment_token_budget` tokens. |

Set `enabled: false` to disable this trigger entirely and rely only on pressure-based and tail-size triggers for historian.

---

## Model Resolution

Each agent has a built-in fallback chain tried in order when no model is explicitly configured. If you have a GitHub Copilot subscription, Copilot-routed models are preferred for historian and dreamer since they use request-based pricing — ideal for single-prompt background work.

| Agent | Fallback Chain (first available wins) |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| **Historian** | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` → `opencode-go/minimax-m2.7` → `zai-coding-plan/glm-5` → `openai/gpt-5.4` → `google/gemini-3.1-pro` |
| **Dreamer** | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` → `google/gemini-3-flash` → `zai-coding-plan/glm-5` → `opencode-go/minimax-m2.7` → `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` |
| **Sidekick** | `cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` → `opencode/gpt-5-nano` → `google/gemini-3-flash` → `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` |

Setting `model` in any agent config overrides the fallback chain entirely. Setting `fallback_models` replaces the built-in chain with your custom list.

> **Tip — Dreamer with local models:** Since the dreamer runs during idle time (typically overnight), it works well with local models. Even slower ones like `ollama/mlx-qwen3.5-27b-claude-4.6-opus-reasoning-distilled` are fine — there's no user waiting.

---

## `historian`

Configures the background historian agent that compresses session history into compartments.

```jsonc
{
  "historian": {
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "fallback_models": [
      "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "bailian-coding-plan/kimi-k2.5"
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Primary model. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Models to try if the primary fails or is rate-limited. |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | Agent variant. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Custom system prompt override. |

---

## `dreamer`

Configures the dreamer agent — both the model it uses and the maintenance tasks it runs. Dreamer creates ephemeral child sessions inside OpenCode for each task.

```jsonc
{
  "dreamer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "fallback_models": ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"],
    "schedule": "02:00-06:00",
    "tasks": ["consolidate", "verify", "archive-stale", "improve", "maintain-docs"]
  }
}
```

### Agent fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Primary model. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Fallback models. |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | Agent variant. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Custom system prompt override. |

### Operational fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable scheduled dreaming. |
| `schedule` | `string` | `"02:00-06:00"` | Time window for overnight runs (24h, supports overnight like `"23:00-05:00"`). |
| `max_runtime_minutes` | `number` | `120` | Max total runtime per dream session. |
| `task_timeout_minutes` | `number` | `20` | Minutes allocated per individual task. |
| `tasks` | `string[]` | `["consolidate", "verify", "archive-stale", "improve"]` | Tasks to run, in order. |
| `inject_docs` | `boolean` | `true` | Inject ARCHITECTURE.md and STRUCTURE.md into the agent system prompt. Content is cached per-session and refreshed on cache-busting passes. |

### Available tasks

| Task | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `consolidate` | Find semantically duplicate memories and merge each cluster into one canonical fact. |
| `verify` | Check CONFIG_DEFAULTS, ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS, and ENVIRONMENT memories against actual code. |
| `archive-stale` | Archive memories that reference removed features, old paths, or discontinued workflows. |
| `improve` | Rewrite verbose or narrative memories into terse operational statements. |
| `maintain-docs` | Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STRUCTURE.md` at project root synchronized with the codebase. |

### How scheduling works

An independent 15-minute timer checks the schedule regardless of user activity, so overnight dreaming triggers even when the user isn't chatting. When the current time falls inside the configured window:

1. The scheduler scans the memory store for projects with activity since the last dream.
2. Eligible projects are enqueued into a SQLite-backed dream queue.
3. The queue consumer processes one project at a time, creating a child session per task.
4. `/ctx-dream` also uses the same queue — it enqueues the current project and immediately processes.

---

## `embedding`

Controls semantic search for cross-session memories.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `"local"` \| `"openai-compatible"` \| `"off"` | `"local"` | `"local"` runs `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` in-process. |
| `model` | `string` | `"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` | Embedding model. |
| `endpoint` | `string` | — | Required for `"openai-compatible"`. |
| `api_key` | `string` | — | Optional API key for remote endpoints. |

```jsonc
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "openai-compatible",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "api_key": "sk-..."
  }
}
```

---

## `memory`

Cross-session memory settings. All memories are scoped to the current project (identified by git root commit hash, with directory-hash fallback for non-git projects).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable cross-session memory. |
| `injection_budget_tokens` | `number` (500–20000) | `4000` | Token budget for memory injection into `<session-history>`. |
| `auto_promote` | `boolean` | `true` | Promote eligible session facts to memory automatically after historian runs. |
| `retrieval_count_promotion_threshold` | `number` | `3` | Retrievals needed before a memory is auto-promoted to permanent. |

---

## `sidekick`

Optional prompt augmenter that runs on `/ctx-aug`. Sidekick is a hidden OpenCode subagent that creates an ephemeral child session, searches memories with `ctx_memory`, and returns a focused context briefing. 
It is useful when starting a new session. It's better to choose a fast and cheap model, even small local models.

```jsonc
{
  "sidekick": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "github-copilot/grok-code-fast-1",
    "fallback_models": ["cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507"],
    "timeout_ms": 30000
  }
}
```

### Agent fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Primary model. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Fallback models. |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | Agent variant. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Agent prompt override. |

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable sidekick. |
| `timeout_ms` | `number` | `30000` | Timeout per run (ms). |
| `system_prompt` | `string` | — | Per-run system prompt override for the sidekick child session. |

---

## Experimental Features

### `experimental_compaction_markers`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `experimental.compaction_markers` | `boolean` | `false` |

When enabled, after historian publishes compartments a compaction boundary is injected into OpenCode's message/part tables. This causes `filterCompacted` to stop at the boundary, dramatically reducing the number of messages processed per transform pass.

### `experimental_user_memories`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `experimental.user_memories.enabled` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `experimental.user_memories.promotion_threshold` | `number` | `3` |

When enabled, historian extracts behavioral observations about the user alongside compartments. These are stored as candidates and reviewed by dreamer during scheduled runs. Recurring patterns that appear across multiple historian runs are promoted to stable user memories, injected into all sessions via `<user-profile>` in the system prompt.

**Requires dreamer to be enabled.** Without dreamer, candidates accumulate but are never promoted to stable memories. The `doctor` command warns about this misconfiguration.

- `promotion_threshold`: minimum number of semantically similar candidate observations before dreamer considers promoting to a stable memory (2–20, default 3).

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ctx-status` | Show current context usage, tag counts, pending queue, nudge state, and history compression info. |
| `/ctx-flush` | Force-execute all pending operations and heuristic cleanup immediately. |
| `/ctx-recomp` | Rebuild compartments and facts from raw session history. Resumable across restarts. |
| `/ctx-dream` | Enqueue the current project for a dream run and process immediately. |
| `/ctx-aug` | Run sidekick augmentation on the provided prompt. |
