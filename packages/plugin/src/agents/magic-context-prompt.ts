Use \`ctx_reduce\` to manage context size. It supports one operation:
- \`drop\`: Remove entirely (best for tool outputs you already acted on).
Syntax: "3-5", "1,2,9", or "1-5,8,12-15". Last ${protectedTags} tags are protected.
Use \`ctx_note\` for deferred intentions — things to tackle later, not right now. NOT for task tracking (use todos). Notes survive context compression and you'll be reminded at natural work boundaries (after commits, historian runs, todo completion).
Use \`ctx_memory\` to manage cross-session project memories. Write new memories or delete stale ones. Memories persist across sessions and are automatically injected into new sessions.
**Save to memory proactively**: If you spent multiple turns finding something (a file path, a DB location, a config pattern, a workaround), save it with \`ctx_memory\` so future sessions don't repeat the search. Examples:
- Found a project's source code path after searching → \`ctx_memory(action="write", category="ENVIRONMENT", content="OpenCode source is at ~/Work/OSS/opencode")\`
- Discovered a non-obvious build/test command → \`ctx_memory(action="write", category="WORKFLOW_RULES", content="Always use scripts/release.sh for releases")\`
- Learned a constraint the hard way → \`ctx_memory(action="write", category="CONSTRAINTS", content="Dashboard Tauri build needs RGBA PNGs, not grayscale")\`
Use \`ctx_search\` to search across project memories, session facts, and conversation history from one query.
Use \`ctx_expand\` to decompress a compartment range to see the original conversation transcript. Use \`start\`/\`end\` from \`<compartment start="N" end="M">\` attributes. Returns the compacted U:/A: transcript for that message range, capped at ~15K tokens.
**Search before asking the user**: If you can't remember or don't know something that might have been discussed before or stored in project memory, use \`ctx_search\` before asking the user. Examples:
- Can't remember where a related codebase or dependency lives → \`ctx_search(query="opencode source code path")\`
- Forgot a prior architectural decision or constraint → \`ctx_search(query="why did we choose SQLite over postgres")\`
- Need a config value, API key location, or environment detail → \`ctx_search(query="embedding provider configuration")\`
- Looking for how something was implemented previously → \`ctx_search(query="how does the dreamer lease work")\`
- Want to recall what was decided in an earlier conversation → \`ctx_search(query="dashboard release signing setup")\`
\`ctx_search\` returns ranked results from memories, session facts, and raw message history. Use message ordinals from results with \`ctx_expand\` to retrieve surrounding conversation context.
${getToolHistoryGuidance(dropToolStructure)}
NEVER drop large ranges blindly (e.g., "1-50"). Review each tag before deciding.
NEVER drop user messages — they are short and will be summarized by compartmentalization automatically. Dropping them loses context the historian needs.
NEVER drop assistant text messages unless they are exceptionally large. Your conversation messages are lightweight; only large tool outputs are worth dropping.
Before your turn finishes, consider using \`ctx_reduce\` to drop large tool outputs you no longer need.`;

/** Intro when ctx_reduce is disabled — no drop guidance, no ctx_reduce references,
 *  and no tag system description. When `ctx_reduce_enabled: false`, transform.ts
 *  skips §N§ prefix injection entirely, so the agent never sees tags — describing
 *  a tagging system they can't observe just wastes tokens and (empirically) primes
 *  some models to emit malformed `§N">§` tokens at the start of their own text. */

### What to Drop
- Large explore/librarian tool outputs after synthesis.
