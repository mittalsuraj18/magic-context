 * Historian state-file offloading.
 *
 * When the existing-state XML (prior compartments + facts + project memory)
 * exceeds {@link HISTORIAN_STATE_INLINE_THRESHOLD} characters, the historian
 * caller writes it to a temp file under the harness-scoped historian dir
 * (see {@link getMagicContextHistorianDir}) and the prompt instructs the
 * model to `Read this file first`. This avoids pushing 100K+ chars of
 * inline reference state through the model's input on long sessions, which
 * on some provider/model combinations (notably github-copilot/gpt-5.4 via
 * the openai-responses API) causes the model to stall before emitting any
 * output tokens.
 *
 * The caller MUST delete the file in finally{} via
 * {@link cleanupHistorianStateFile}.
 *
 * Shared between OpenCode (`compartment-runner-incremental.ts`,
 * `compartment-runner-recomp.ts`) and Pi (`pi-historian-runner.ts`).
 * The directory is resolved at call time so it follows whichever harness
 * loaded the plugin (OpenCode → `${tmpdir}/opencode/magic-context/historian`,
 * Pi → `${tmpdir}/pi/magic-context/historian`).
